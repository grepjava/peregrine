"""Builds the Swift server and packages it.

By default the server is built as ``peregrine._native``, a CPython extension
module. The interpreter that imports it supplies Python -- no libpython is
linked -- and on a distribution python, which is a statically linked,
position-dependent executable, framework code runs 10-15 % faster that way than
in the shared libpython an embedding executable has to use (BENCHMARKS.md).

PEREGRINE_BUILD=binary builds the standalone executable instead, which embeds
libpython and is started by the launcher with execv. Both take the same command
line, and ``peregrine`` runs whichever the package carries.

Either way the result is bound to one CPython ABI, so a wheel is tagged for
exactly the interpreter and platform it was built for
(`cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_39_x86_64`, `cp314-cp314t-...`) and pip refuses it
anywhere it would not load. When no wheel matches, pip falls back to the sdist
and this file compiles the server for the installing interpreter.

The wheel does not vendor libpython -- that would fight the interpreter the
user already has. It does vendor the Swift runtime, with a relative rpath, so a
machine that has never seen this toolchain can still load the server.

Requirements when compiling (sdist or `scripts/build-wheel.sh`):
  * a Swift toolchain (swift 6.1 or newer) on PATH
  * the Python development files for the interpreter being installed into,
    found by pkg-config as python3 (python3-embed for the binary)
  * patchelf on Linux, so the Swift runtime can travel with the server
