# The module is written to python/peregrine/ under that interpreter's
# extension suffix (_native.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so), so
# `python -m peregrine` with python/ on PYTHONPATH serves through it.
#
# It links no libpython. The Python symbols are resolved from the interpreter
# that imports it, which on a distribution python is a statically linked,
# position-dependent executable -- faster for framework code than
# libpython3.x.so, which is the reason this build exists.
#
# The headers have to be that interpreter's. They are found through its
# python3.pc; set PKG_CONFIG_PATH when sysconfig does not know where that is
# (relocated builds such as uv's report the path they were built at).
