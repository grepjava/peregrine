// --cache-size: answering repeated requests without calling the application.
//
// A GET the application marked fresh -- `Cache-Control: s-maxage` or
// `max-age` -- is copied as it is sent, and stored in a table every worker
// shares (peregrine_cache.c). A later request for the same URL, on any worker
// and over any protocol, is answered from that copy until it expires. What may
// be kept is decided in PeregrineHTTP's ResponseCachePolicy, conservatively:
// the thing this must never do is hand one user's response to another.
//
// The key is the scheme, the host and the whole request target, plus the
// forwarding headers when the peer is a trusted proxy, since those change
// what the application thinks it was asked. HEAD is answered from a GET's
// copy and never stores one. A response that says `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is
// kept with its request's Accept-Encoding, and served only to requests that
// send the same one; another reaches the application, and its response takes
// the copy's place.
//
// A request's own `max-age` and `min-fresh` are honoured too: a copy older
// than the one, or with less left than the other, is not what it asked for.
//
// A request that changes its target -- any method but GET, HEAD, OPTIONS,
// TRACE and CONNECT -- is marked at dispatch. When its response has a 2xx or
// 3xx status, the target is invalidated in the table (RFC 9111 section 4.4):
// its copies, and the response to any GET for it dispatched before then that
// has yet to be stored.
//
// A copy is kept for what is left of the response's freshness lifetime once
// its age -- Age, Date, and the time the application took -- is taken off.
//
// A copy holds the application's own headers and body, not the bytes that
// went on the wire, so one copy serves HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 alike and
// is compressed afresh for each client that accepts it. Date, Age,
// X-Request-ID, HSTS and the rest of what the server adds are written for
// every response as it is sent, with `Cache-Status: peregrine; hit` to say
// where it came from.
//
// The copy is taken in one place per application interface: for ASGI as the
// messages arrive, for WSGI in the response builder shared by the inline and
// pooled paths. Either way it is stored only when the response ended the way
// its head said it would.
