// --trace-context: a W3C traceparent, recorded in the access log.
//
// A request that arrives inside a distributed trace carries `traceparent`.
// With its trace ID and parent span on the access line, the line can be found
// from the trace and the trace from the line.
//
// Recorded, never made up and never changed. The application already has the
// header among its request headers, which is where an OpenTelemetry
// propagator reads it. A traceparent the server invented would name a parent
// span that nothing ever recorded, and a trace backend would show the
// application's spans hanging from a gap.
//
// What counts as a readable traceparent is AvianHTTP's TraceContext. On
// top of that, a request carrying more than one is ignored: two traceparents
// disagree about which trace this is, and the specification has a receiver
// trust neither.
