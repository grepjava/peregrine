//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
// Compressing a response body as it is written.
//
// The encoder sits between the application's bytes and the framing, and it is
// the same encoder for every transport: on HTTP/1.1 its output is chunked, on
// HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 the stream flushers turn it into DATA frames like any other
// body. What changes per transport is only where the Content-Encoding header
// goes, and that is in the writers.
//
// A compressed response has no Content-Length, because nobody knows it until
// the last byte. The application's own declared length is still enforced -- it
// is a promise about how much the application sends, and the checks against it
// are made on the bytes going in, not on the bytes coming out.
//
// Each body message the application sends is flushed through, so what it sent
// is what the client can read. A streaming response compressed any other way
// holds its bytes in the compressor until enough pile up, which for a progress
// report or a long poll is until it is too late.
