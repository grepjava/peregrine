// The QUIC listener.
//
// One UDP socket serves every client, so this is nothing like the TCP path.
// There is no accept: a datagram arrives, its destination connection ID is
// looked up, and either it belongs to a connection or it is the first packet
// of a new one. Everything else -- ordering, retransmission, congestion --
// happens inside QUICConnection.
//
// Each worker binds its own socket with SO_REUSEPORT, so the kernel hashes
// arriving datagrams by four-tuple and a client's packets consistently reach
// the same worker. The cost of that choice is that a client which genuinely
// migrates to a new address may be hashed to a different worker, which has
// never heard of its connection; it recovers by making a new one.
