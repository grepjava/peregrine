//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
// Turning a WSGI application's return value into response bytes.
//
// This is shared by the two execution models: the inline one, where the worker
// loop calls the application itself, and the pooled one, where a thread does.
// Both must produce byte-for-byte identical output, so the framing decision and
// the header serialisation live here rather than in either caller.
//
// Everything the builder needs about the request is captured in a snapshot
// first. That matters for the pooled path: a thread must not read connection
// state the loop could be changing underneath it, so it reads a copy taken at
// submit time instead.
//
// Framing is decided after the application returns, with full information:
//   * the application set Content-Length      -> pass it through
//   * the result is a list or tuple           -> sum the parts, set it ourselves
//   * HTTP/1.1 and unknown length             -> chunked
//   * HTTP/1.0 and unknown length             -> stream and close
