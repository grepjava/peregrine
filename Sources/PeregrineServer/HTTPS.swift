// Plain HTTP to HTTPS: the redirect port, and Strict-Transport-Security.
//
// --redirect-http PORT listens for plain HTTP beside the TLS port and answers
// every request with a redirect to the same host and path over https. Like the
// metrics port, it is a listener of its own in every worker, answered without a
// connection slot, and it shares the metrics port's few places for a request
// that has not finished arriving. A redirect is one small request and one small
// response followed by a close, so it needs nothing more than that.
//
// --hsts SECONDS reduces how often the redirect is needed at all. A browser
// that has seen Strict-Transport-Security on an https response goes straight to
// https for that long, so the plain request that could be intercepted is never
// sent. It goes on TLS responses only. A browser ignores it over plain HTTP,
// where anyone in the path could have added it.
