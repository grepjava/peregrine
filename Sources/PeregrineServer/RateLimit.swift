// --rate-limit: turning a client away with 429 before the application runs.
//
// The accounting lives in C, in a table every worker shares; see
// avian_ratelimit.h for why it has to. What is here is deciding who the
// client is, and saying no.
//
// Who the client is follows the same rule as everything else about forwarded
// headers: behind a trusted proxy it is the address the proxy reports, and
// otherwise it is the peer. Keying by the peer behind a proxy would put every
// user in one bucket, and believing an untrusted X-Forwarded-For would let
// any client pick a fresh bucket per request.
