// The scrape port.
//
// A separate listener, on a separate port, answered without going anywhere
// near the request path. That is the point: the application must not be able
// to see a scrape, and a scrape must not be able to reach the application.
//
// Every worker binds it with SO_REUSEPORT, exactly as they bind the service
// port, so a scrape lands on whichever worker the kernel picks -- and it does
// not matter which, because the counters are shared and the answer is the sum
// over all of them.
//
// A scrape is a few dozen bytes in and a couple of kilobytes out, once every
// scrape interval, so nearly always it is accepted, read, answered and closed
// without ever going round the loop again. What stops that from being the
// whole story is that a request arriving in more than one segment is a request
// this has only half of: answering it early means closing under a peer that is
// still writing, which costs it an EPIPE on writes it had every right to make
// and can cost it the answer itself, since a close with unread bytes still
// inbound is a reset, and a reset may discard what the kernel had buffered to
// deliver.
//
// So a scrape that has not finished arriving waits -- but only in ways that
// cannot reach the request path. There are `metricsPendingCount` places to
// wait in and no more, each with a deadline and a ceiling on how much it will
// hold, and the loop is never blocked on any of them: they are poller
// registrations like anything else. When a ninth arrives, the one held longest
// is answered from whatever it has sent and the newcomer takes its place,
// rather than anything starting to queue.
