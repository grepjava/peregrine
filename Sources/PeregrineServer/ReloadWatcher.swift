//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
// --reload: restart workers when the application source changes.
//
// This is a development convenience, run from the supervisor, so it is written
// for clarity: ordinary Swift strings and arrays, ARC and all. Nothing here
// runs in a worker or touches a request.
//
// What decides whether anything changed is a scan: a digest over the path and
// modification time of every watched file. It works the same on Linux and
// macOS, survives editors that replace files rather than writing them in
// place, and costs a stat() walk -- a few milliseconds at most for a project
// tree.
//
// What decides when to scan is the kernel where it can say, and a clock
// everywhere. Every directory the scan walks is watched -- inotify on Linux,
// kqueue on macOS -- and a change wakes the supervisor, which scans once the
// save has had a moment to finish: an editor writes a temporary file, renames
// it and touches the directory in several steps, and scanning after the first
// would reload twice. The scan still runs every --reload-interval as well,
// because a notification is not always delivered: a bind mount, a network
// filesystem or WSL's view of a Windows drive may never send one, and on macOS
// only a directory's own changes are watched, so a file written in place is
// not seen. There, the watcher is exactly the poller it always was.
