//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
// Metrics, and the port they are scraped from.
//
// Two problems, and they pull in opposite directions.
//
// Counting has to be free. These counters sit on the accept path and the
// response path, so anything that locks, allocates or crosses a cache line
// shared with another worker would cost more than the thing it measures. Each
// worker writes only its own slot of a shared page, with relaxed loads and
// stores -- a load, an add and a store, no lock prefix, no contention.
//
// Scraping has to see all of it. A scrape is one connection, and with
// --workers it lands on whichever worker SO_REUSEPORT gives it; a worker that
// answered with its own numbers would report a fraction that changes between
// scrapes. So the page is mapped MAP_SHARED before the fork, and whoever
// answers sums every slot. The same code covers --free-threaded, where the
// workers are threads and share the mapping because they share everything.
//
// The scrape itself is deliberately not run through the server's own request
// path: that path dispatches to the application, and an operator's monitoring
// should not be able to reach it. It is a handful of bytes accepted, read and
// answered inline on the loop thread, with no connection slot and no state
// machine -- bounded work, once every scrape interval.
