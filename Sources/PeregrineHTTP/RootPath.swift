// --root-path: the prefix a proxy mounts the application under.
//
// It is reported to the application as SCRIPT_NAME and as the ASGI root_path,
// and it comes off the front of a request's path so that PATH_INFO and the
// ASGI path are the path within the application.
//
// Only a whole leading segment comes off. A request that does not start with
// the prefix keeps its path as it came -- which is every request behind a proxy
// that already removed the prefix, the usual way uvicorn's --root-path is
// deployed, and a health check that bypasses the mount. One that shares only
// the first letters of a segment, `/apis` under `/api`, is not under the mount.
//
// The prefix is matched against the percent-decoded path, the one the
// application is given, so `/%61pi/users` is under `/api` as `/api/users` is.
// ASGI's raw_path keeps the target as it came.
