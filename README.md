- **Faster with the framework you already use.** In the published results of
  the-benchmarker/web-frameworks, the same FastAPI application answers 1.2–1.3×
  as many requests on Peregrine as on uvicorn, and Django 7–34× as many as on
  gunicorn. On four CPUs here, BlackSheep reaches 202,000 requests a second and
  FastAPI 77,000. [How that was measured.](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine#numbers)
- **Nothing to change in the application.** ASGI 3 and PEP 3333 in full, for
  FastAPI, Starlette, Django and Flask, with lifespan and WebSockets. The
  protocol is detected, and the options are the ones you know:
  [coming from uvicorn or gunicorn](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine#coming-from-uvicorn-or-gunicorn).
- **What usually needs a proxy in front, built in.** HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, TLS
  with Let's Encrypt certificates, static files with `sendfile`, compression,
  rate limiting, a response cache, Prometheus metrics, and a `SIGHUP` that
  replaces every worker without refusing a connection.
- **Free-threaded Python.** On CPython 3.14t, `--free-threaded` runs the
  workers as threads of one process: the throughput of processes at a third
  of the memory.
- **Wheels for Linux x86_64 and aarch64**, CPython 3.11 to 3.14 and 3.14t,
  including the official `python:*-slim` images. No Swift toolchain needed.

Built around two goals: spend as little time as possible outside the
application, and spend as little memory as possible per connection.

It runs in the same process as CPython — there is no socket between Swift and
Python, no serialisation step, and no second process. Swift owns the accept
loop, the HTTP parser and the response writer; Python owns the application. A
wheel installs the server as `peregrine._native`, an extension module the
`peregrine` command loads into your own interpreter, so applications run in
exactly the `python3` they were installed for.

```
pip install peregrine-server                # wheel if one matches; else compiled

peregrine --port 8000 myapp:application     # WSGI, protocol auto-detected
peregrine --port 8000 --workers 0 myapp:app # ASGI, one worker per CPU
peregrine --reload myapp:app                # restart on source changes

peregrine --http3 --tls-cert cert.pem --tls-key key.pem myapp:app
```

## Numbers

The suite's own applications and load command, from
[the-benchmarker/web-frameworks](https://web-frameworks-benchmark.netlify.app/):
zrk, an open-loop ramp to 500,000 requests a second, 15 s per level, with
`--workers $(nproc)`. Requests per second at 64 / 256 / 512 connections, the
mean of three runs, all in one session, WSL2 on 4 CPUs with the load generator
on the same machine, CPython 3.14, Peregrine 1.1.5:

| on Peregrine | 64 | 256 | 512 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| raw WSGI | **293,025** | **302,417** | 256,660 |
| raw ASGI | 221,826 | 271,396 | **260,155** |
| BlackSheep | 179,208 | 202,141 | 197,687 |
| FastAPI | 57,553 | 72,306 | 76,818 |
| Flask | 49,933 | 50,423 | 50,964 |
| Django | 46,058 | 47,806 | 45,806 |
| *Elysia on Bun, for reference* | *346,465* | *350,622* | *356,547* |

No run returned an error. The raw entries vary most between runs, by up to a
quarter, so their order at 512 connections means nothing.

The site measures on its own machine, 16 CPUs, so its figures cannot be set
beside these. What it shows is the same frameworks on different servers.
Peregrine was
[added to the suite](https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks/pull/9776)
in September 2026; in its dataset of 2026-09-13, on Peregrine 1.0:

| site entry | 64 | 256 | 512 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FastAPI on **peregrine** | **54,338** | **59,273** | **60,201** |
| FastAPI on uvicorn | 41,891 | 47,335 | 48,552 |
| Django on **peregrine** | **39,840** | **39,718** | **39,654** |
| Django on gunicorn | 1,165 | 5,727 | 4,699 |

[BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md)
has the latency, every run, the versions, where this machine differs from the
suite's, and the commands that repeat it.

These are hello-world routes, so they measure what a server adds to a request
rather than what an application can do. A real application doing database work
will be dominated by that work, and the gaps will narrow accordingly.

The server is about 1.7 MB of text and data as the extension module (1.3 MB as
the executable, which needs no position-independent code), and a live connection costs
one 16 KiB pooled read buffer plus a slot of about 200 bytes. Nearly all of a
worker's resident memory is CPython and the application.

## Coming from uvicorn or gunicorn

Point Peregrine at the same application object. The protocol is detected, so
there is no worker class to name, and most options keep their names. What
differs is mostly units, because Peregrine's timeouts are in milliseconds:

| uvicorn | gunicorn | peregrine |
|---|---|---|
| `uvicorn main:app` | `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app` | `peregrine main:app` |
| | `gunicorn myproject.wsgi` | `peregrine myproject.wsgi:application` |
| `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` | `-b 0.0.0.0:8000` | `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` |
| `--uds /run/app.sock` | `-b unix:/run/app.sock` | `--unix /run/app.sock` |
| `--workers 4` | `-w 4` | `--workers 4`, or `0` for one per CPU |
| | `--threads 8` | `--wsgi-threads 8` |
| `--reload` | `--reload` | `--reload` |
| `--ssl-certfile c.pem --ssl-keyfile k.pem` | `--certfile c.pem --keyfile k.pem` | `--tls-cert c.pem --tls-key k.pem` |
| `--forwarded-allow-ips '*'` | `--forwarded-allow-ips '*'` | `--forwarded-allow-ips '*'` |
| `--root-path /api` | | `--root-path /api` |
| `--timeout-keep-alive 5` | `--keep-alive 5` | `--keep-alive 5000` |
| `--timeout-graceful-shutdown 30` | `--graceful-timeout 30` | `--graceful-timeout 30000` |
| `--lifespan off` | | `--no-lifespan` |
| `--ws-max-size 16777216` | | `--ws-max-message 16777216` |
| `--ws-ping-interval 20` | | `--ws-ping-interval 20000` |
| `--factory` | | `--factory` |
| access log on by default | `--access-logfile -` | `--access-log` |
| `--log-level info` | `--log-level info` | `--log-level info` |

uvloop is used when it is installed (`pip install "peregrine-server[uvloop]"`),
as with uvicorn. `SIGTERM` drains the workers, and `SIGHUP` replaces them one
at a time without refusing a connection.

## What is supported

| | HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 | HTTP/3 | WebSocket | WebTransport |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASGI | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| WSGI | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 501 | 501 |

WebSockets and WebTransport are refused for WSGI rather than half-served: both
are streams that outlive their response, and PEP 3333 has no way to express
one. Everything else is the same code for both — see
[one request path](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/TRANSPORT.md#one-request-path).

**WSGI (PEP 3333):** full environ, `wsgi.input` as a C-level stream (`read`,
`readline`, `readlines`, iteration), `start_response` including `exc_info`
semantics and the legacy `write` callable, `wsgi.file_wrapper`, iterable
`close()`, repeated request headers folded per spec, automatic
`Content-Length`/chunked framing. `start_response` may be called from inside
the first iteration of the returned iterable, as the spec requires a server to
allow, and a `Content-Length` the application declares is
[enforced](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/TRANSPORT.md#framing-is-enforced-not-trusted) rather than trusted.

Output is unbuffered in the sense PEP 3333 means. A block yielded by an
iterator goes to the socket before the next one is asked for, and a block
handed to `write()` goes out before the call returns — taking the response head
with it, if it is the first. A generator that yields a progress line and then
works for a second is therefore seen to do so. A list or tuple return value is
still written in one go, because every part of it is already in hand and
nothing is waiting.

**ASGI 3.0 (HTTP):** full scope including `client`, `server`, `raw_path` and
`state`, streaming request bodies, streaming responses with genuine write
backpressure, `http.disconnect`, and the lifespan protocol with state shared
into request scopes. Applications that do not implement lifespan are detected
and skipped. Response headers are accepted in any shape the specification
allows — tuples or lists, `bytes`, `bytearray` or `str`.

An ASGI application is started as soon as the request head is parsed, not once
the body has finished arriving. That is what lets one reject an upload at byte
one — unauthorised, too large, wrong content type — instead of paying to
receive all of it first, and it is the only way `receive()` can mean anything on
a request that is still being sent. Body bytes are read no further ahead than
the application has asked for.

Answering early leaves the rest of that body on the wire, and it is not a
request. If what remains is small and already here it is swallowed and the
connection is reused; otherwise that response is the last one on the
connection.

A `receive()` made after the response is complete is answered with
`http.disconnect` rather than parked. The request is over at that point, and a
task waiting on a body nobody will read holds the connection with it.

Interim (1xx) responses can go out before `http.response.start`, over
HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, including while the request body is still
arriving. `http.response.early_hint` is the ASGI extension of that name, a 103
with one Link field per entry in `links`. `http.response.informational` is
Peregrine's, for any other status from 102 to 199 with the `headers` given:

```python
await send({"type": "http.response.informational", "status": 104,
            "headers": [(b"location", b"/uploads/7")]})
```

Both are listed in `scope["extensions"]`. 100 and 101 stay the server's, a
header that frames or belongs to the connection is refused, and to an
HTTP/1.0 client, which has no interim responses, nothing is sent.

**Resumable uploads:** `peregrine.contrib.uploads` serves the IETF resumable
upload protocol (draft-ietf-httpbis-resumable-upload, interop version 9) in
front of any ASGI application. A client cut off mid-upload asks how much
arrived and sends the rest, over any protocol and on any worker, and the
application is called once, with the whole body on disk:

```python
from peregrine.contrib.uploads import FileUploadStore, ResumableUploads, UploadLimits

async def finished(upload):              # every byte is in upload.path
    shutil.move(upload.path, destination(upload.metadata["user"]))
    upload.remove()
    return 201, [(b"content-type", b"text/plain")], b"stored\n"

app = ResumableUploads(api, "/files", store=FileUploadStore("/var/lib/app/uploads"),
                       limits=UploadLimits(max_size=10 << 30),
                       on_create=lambda scope: {"user": user_of(scope)},
                       on_complete=finished)
```

The client is told where its upload lives by a 104 before any of the body is
read. The upload's URL (`/uploads/<id>`) answers HEAD with the offset, PATCH
appends from it, DELETE cancels it, and GET gives a client that lost its
answer the one `on_complete` returned. `on_create` sees the request that
created the upload and whatever it returns reaches `on_complete` as
`metadata`, so it is where to record whose upload it is: the request that
finishes an upload is a later one. Uploads are files and `flock`s in the store's
directory, so workers need nothing else to share them; the limits,
`Content-Digest` and `Repr-Digest` checks, expiry, and the rest of what the
draft leaves to the server are described in
[the module](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/python/peregrine/contrib/uploads.py). It is the protocol Garuda's
`GarudaUploads` serves, decided the same way.

**ASGI 3.0 (WebSocket):** the full connect / accept / receive / send / close
cycle, subprotocol negotiation, extra handshake headers, fragmented messages,
text and binary, keepalive ping/pong with a dead-peer timeout, and a message
size limit. [Details.](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/TRANSPORT.md#websocket)

**WebTransport:** sessions, streams in both directions, unreliable datagrams
and the close capsule, through a documented
[ASGI extension](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/TRANSPORT.md#the-asgi-extension) — ASGI has no WebTransport
specification, so this one is Peregrine's.

**Free-threaded CPython (PEP 703):** `--free-threaded` runs the workers as
threads of one process rather than as processes, on an interpreter built
without the GIL. Same parallelism, one copy of the application:

```bash
peregrine --workers 0 --free-threaded myapp:app
```

On four cores with a CPU-bound application that is 5,907 req/s in 47 MB against
5,832 req/s in 143 MB for four worker processes — the throughput of processes
at a third of the memory, because the application is imported once instead of
four times. The ASGI lifespan runs once per worker thread, on the event loop that
thread serves requests with, so what an application opens in `startup` is
attached to the loop that will await
it. [Details.](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/CONFIG.md#free-threaded-python)

## Installing

A wheel is tagged for one CPython and one platform. PyPI has them for CPython
3.11 to 3.14 and free-threaded 3.14t, on Linux x86_64 and aarch64 with glibc
2.35 or newer: Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04, what came after them, and the official
`python:*-slim` images. When one matches, `pip` installs it and Swift is not
required. When none does, as on macOS, Alpine or an older distribution, `pip`
compiles the sdist against the interpreter you are installing into:

```bash
pip install peregrine-server
```

In a container nothing else is needed:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir "peregrine-server[uvloop]" fastapi
COPY main.py .
CMD ["peregrine", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--workers", "0", "main:app"]
```

```bash
# plus a Swift 6.1+ toolchain from https://swift.org/install
git clone https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine
cd peregrine && bash scripts/build-extension.sh    # peregrine._native
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m peregrine --port 8000 myapp:app
```

The extension module is the default wherever Peregrine is installed or built
from source. `swift build -c release -Xswiftc -enforce-exclusivity=unchecked`
builds the standalone executable, which embeds `libpython` and takes the same
options; it is for working on Peregrine itself.

Requirements, per-platform packages, certificates and the failure modes worth
recognising: [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md).

  --version                print the version and exit
```

The protocol is detected by inspecting the callable: a coroutine function, or
one taking three positional parameters, is ASGI; two parameters is WSGI. Force
it with `--protocol` if your application is wrapped in something opaque.

`SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` drains gracefully, with a deadline. `SIGHUP` replaces
every worker one at a time, each replacement accepting on the socket its
predecessor had before that one is asked to stop, so nothing is refused and
nothing is reset -- which also makes it the certbot deploy hook, because the
replacements read the certificate off disk again. See
[reloading without a restart](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/CONFIG.md#reloading-without-a-restart), and the
[shutdown sequence](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md#shutdown), which is more careful than it
looks and deliberately so.

### Behind a reverse proxy

`--forwarded-allow-ips` takes a comma-separated list of addresses or CIDR
blocks, `unix`, or `*` for every peer. Only headers arriving from a peer on
that list are honoured; from anyone else `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`
and `Forwarded` are ignored rather than trusted, because a client can send them
too.

---

## Frameworks

Checked against real applications rather than only the specifications
(`bash scripts/framework-test.sh`):

- **FastAPI** (ASGI) — routing, middleware, `lifespan` context managers
  including teardown on `SIGTERM`, `StreamingResponse`, WebSocket endpoints
  driven by the `websockets` client, the generated OpenAPI document, and the
  `anyio` worker threads FastAPI uses for synchronous endpoints.
- **Flask** (WSGI) — routing, request bodies, streamed responses,
  `request.is_secure` and `request.remote_addr` derived from forwarded headers,
  and blocking views overlapping properly on `--wsgi-threads`.

Both run over HTTP/3 with no integration at all: a request is the same request
whatever carried it. WebTransport is the exception for FastAPI, because a
session is not a request — Starlette's router asserts on the scope type before
it routes — so `peregrine.contrib` puts a router in front that answers sessions
and passes everything else through:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from peregrine.contrib.fastapi import WebTransportRouter

api = FastAPI()
app = WebTransportRouter(api)            # serve this one

@app.route("/chat/{room}")
async def chat(session):
    await session.accept()
    async for stream in session.incoming_streams():
        await stream.send(b"hello " + await stream.read(), end=True)
```

Flask needs nothing at all: as a WSGI application it is served over HTTP/1.1,
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and WebSocket and WebTransport, which PEP 3333 cannot
express, are refused with a 501.

## Why Swift

The interesting question is not "why not C" but "why not Python, or Rust, or
Go", since all four can host an application server and three of them are more
usual choices for one.

**It compiles to a native binary with no runtime to schedule around.** A server
is a loop over a poller; anything that inserts its own scheduler between the
loop and the syscall — a garbage collector that stops the world, a green-thread
runtime that decides when a read happens — buys concurrency this design does
not need and costs latency it cannot recover. Swift has neither. Reference
counting is deterministic, and where it would cost anything it can be removed,
which is a large part of [what the server does](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md#minimising-arc).

**It talks to C without a binding layer.** Embedding CPython means calling a C
API constantly: `PyDict_SetItem`, `PyObject_Vectorcall`, `Py_DECREF`, a few
hundred times per request. In Swift those are direct calls through a thin shim
for the parts that are macros. There is no FFI marshalling, no
`unsafe` boundary to justify per call site, and no second object model to keep
in step with CPython's — a `PyObject *` is an `OpaquePointer`, and a
`~Copyable` struct makes the compiler prove the decref happens exactly once.
The same is true of OpenSSL, epoll and `recvmmsg`.

**It is memory-safe by default and unsafe on request.** Almost all of this
server is ordinary safe Swift: bounds-checked, ownership-checked, no null. The
hot path opts out deliberately and locally — raw pointers into a read buffer, a
slab of connection structs — and those opt-outs are visible in the source
because they have to be spelled `Unsafe`. That is a better default for a
network-facing parser than a language where everything is unsafe and discipline
is the only guard, and a better ceiling than one where the escape hatch is
awkward enough that you write the slow thing instead.

**Generics and value types make the fast version the readable one.** `ByteBuffer`
is a struct passed in registers; the HTTP parser returns offsets into it; the
QUIC packet builder writes through a `~Copyable` writer that cannot be aliased.
None of that needs a comment explaining what the pointer arithmetic is for,
because there is no pointer arithmetic in it.

The honest costs: the ecosystem for this kind of work is small, so the QUIC
stack, the TLS 1.3 handshake, HPACK and QPACK are all written here rather than
pulled in; Linux tooling is thinner than C's; and Foundation is avoided
entirely because it would bring back the allocation behaviour the design exists
to remove.

## Correctness and hardening

The HTTP/1.1 parser is strict wherever strictness prevents request smuggling —
whitespace before a colon, `Content-Length` with `Transfer-Encoding`,
disagreeing lengths, any `Transfer-Encoding` that is not a bare `chunked`,
`obs-fold`, a missing or repeated `Host`.
Response headers containing CR or LF are refused outright. Request header names
containing underscores are dropped, and a `Proxy:` header is dropped entirely.
[The full list.](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/TRANSPORT.md#strictness-that-prevents-smuggling)

Every transport is checked against an implementation that shares none of its
code, because a test written against the same understanding as the code proves
only that the understanding is consistent.

```bash
swift test                                      # the fuzz corpus, replayed
                                                #   through every parser
bash scripts/integration-test.sh                #  62 end-to-end checks
python3 scripts/feature-test.py                 # 251 checks for the failure
                                                #   modes a plain request never
                                                #   reaches: slow consumers,
                                                #   stuck-request shutdown,
                                                #   lifespan cleanup, worker
                                                #   restarts, reload
bash scripts/framework-test.sh                  # checks against real FastAPI
                                                #   and Flask applications,
                                                #   over HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

                                                #   and WebTransport

```

[CI](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs all of it on every push, against CPython
3.11 through 3.14 and a free-threaded 3.14, on Linux and macOS, plus the
fuzzer under AddressSanitizer. The suites are the ones above — there is no
CI-only test path, so a green run there means what a green run here means.
[More on the fuzzing.](https://github.com/grepjava/peregrine/blob/main/fuzz/README.md)

HTTP/2 conformance is checked with
[h2spec](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec), which is not vendored here:

```bash
peregrine --port 8443 --tls-cert cert.pem --tls-key key.pem examples.asgi_app:app &
h2spec -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8443 -t -k    # 146 tests, 146 passed
```

The parsers, framing, HPACK, QPACK and QUIC have their unit tests in
[aviancore](https://github.com/grepjava/aviancore), where that code lives.
QUIC packet protection is checked there against RFC 9001 appendix A directly:
the key schedule, the header protection and the sample packets are the RFC's
own bytes.

## What is not

- **`sendfile` for `wsgi.file_wrapper`.** The wrapper works and streams in
  chunks, but does not yet drop into `sendfile(2)` the way `--static-dir`
  does.
- **Byte ranges and directory indexes for `--static-dir`.** It serves assets
  with an `ETag` and answers `If-None-Match`; it is not a file server.
- **Compressing `--static-dir` files on the fly.** `--compress-static` serves
  copies compressed at build time; a file with no copy is sent as it is, which
  keeps `sendfile(2)` and keeps the CPU for requests.
- **SNI for HTTP/3.** Several certificates are chosen by name over TCP;
  HTTP/3 serves the first pair whatever the client asks for, because the QUIC
  handshake here is built from the primitives rather than driven by OpenSSL.
- **QUIC connection migration across workers, and 0-RTT.** A connection
  survives a change of address, but not a change of worker, and every handshake
  is a full one.
- **HTTP/3 server push, and WebSocket over HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.** HTTP/3
  advertises extended `CONNECT` because that is how WebTransport arrives;
  `webtransport` is the only `:protocol` served. HTTP/2 does not advertise it.
- **Windows.** The I/O layer is epoll/kqueue.
- **Spans.** `--trace-context` puts an incoming W3C trace on the access-log
  line and hands the header to the application untouched, and there are
  Prometheus metrics on `--metrics-port`, but the server records no
  OpenTelemetry spans of its own. The application's instrumentation is the
  right place for those, and there are good ones.

By default a synchronous WSGI application occupies its worker for the duration
of the call. Scale with `--workers`, and with `--wsgi-threads` when the
application spends its time waiting on I/O rather than on the CPU.
